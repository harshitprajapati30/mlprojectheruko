This is ML and Data Science project. It is basically a price predicting model based on LinearRegression algorithm from scikit learn library. The dataset has been taken from KAGGLE website for training the model.
It interacts with the user with a website which take inputs such as total area, bhk, bathrooms and locality. The website is written in Python using its Flask library alongwith the basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript codes. 
After taking inputs, the model predicts the home price that is displayed at the bottom in INR. Moreover, the website is deployed on Heroku which is PAAS.
